# python-class-examples
Various Python data analysis examples used in my courses. All of these Jupyter Notebooks have been tested in [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com) with a T4 GPU (although the TitanicSurvival examples [including MLJAR] do not require a GPU runtime).

For help with learning Python, see my [python-bootcamp](https://github.com/davedgd/python-bootcamp).
